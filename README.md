# Guidance-Training
Improve Cross-domain Mixed Sampling with Guidance Training for Adaptive Segmentation
(This paper is going through peer review and when accepted, all the code will be released)

## Note: 
Recently, we are implementing Guidance Training on the MiT architecture, and we found that our approach can still be further improved on the MIT architecture based on related approaches such as MIC and HRDA. 

If you are interested in our paper and code, please let us know by leaving a comment on issue. 

Although the paper is undergoing blind review,  we will disclose our training code and configuration files on DeepLab before the end of September.
